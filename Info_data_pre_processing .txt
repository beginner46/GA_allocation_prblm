Data Pre-processing
 ●   We took the demand and potential data sets and identified important features.

 ●   The features that were taken into consideration were travel time and location (X and Y
     coordinates of a point) and density of a potential location.




What each python script does
 ●   location_potential_norm = normalised location points for potential data sets.
 ●   Editing_Potential_Data_Set = extracted important features from potential data
     set.
 ●   demand_data_8_12.ipynb = worked on demand data in the time frame of 8_12.
 ●   demand_data_12_16.ipynb = worked on demand data in the time frame of
     12_16.
 ●   Normalising_demand.ipynb = Normalising the data in demand data set.
 ●   normalized_time_travel.ipynb = Normalising the data in the time travel set.
